# totally bad way to make 250 digits of pi

Used bellard's code because, HE IS A GENIUS.

https://bellard.org/pi/

I messed it up and compiled it with wasm and well there you are.

If he ever sees this repo I am sorry.

You must install emsdk for this to work.

```
emcc tonypi.c -o test.html
```

Then start a python server to see the results.
